# Alberta bird models using ABMI+BAM+BBS data

> Last updated: 2020

This repository contains code to reproduce the 2020 version of Alberta bird models presented on the ABMI data and mapping portals.

The numbered R scripts are the distinct steps in the process (functions that all steps might need, data processing, data packaging, model summaries, prediction/mapping).

The `cc` folder contains code to run the models on WestGrid computing cluster.

The `sector-effects` folder contains code for calculating sector effects.

*The code in this repo originates from the <https://github.com/psolymos/abmianalytics> project.*
